# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
To check my ability to transform and analyse provided dataset. The goal is to process and show each step from data load to continues QA
## Process
Step1. Loaded csv files into Database as per instructions.
Step2. Data cleaning. For all tables was checking 
- the duplicates,
- nulls and negative values,
- different data types
- similar names with "typos" (Refferal and refferal)
- data values mathing to the pattern (sku lenght),
- extra spaces,
- matching similar information in different tables
- matching comparable data in the same table (e.g visitstarttime and orderdate)
- existance of the second step without existing first step (e.g. customer with null time on web site making order)
## Results
